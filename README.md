# grafika3 - Rubber Sheet

## Specification

Create rubber sheet simulator to demonstrate gravity.

The rubber sheet has a flat torus topology (what goes out comes in on the opposite side). <br />
The rubber sheet is has diffuse and ambient coefficients that darkens in steps according to the indentation. <br />

Place a high mass body by pressing the right mouse button. <br />
The high mass bodies curve the rubber sheet. <br />
The high mass bodies are invisible.

Place a small ball by pressing the left mouse button. <br />
The ball is placed in the bottom left corner. <br />
The ball has an initial momentum with direction and amplitude depending on the mouse position. <br />
The balls move frictionlessly. <br />
The balls are coloured diffuse-specular.

The balls are absorved if colliding with the masses. <br />
The collisions between the balls need not be considered.

Two point light sources illumiate the sheet. <br />
The light soruces rotate around each other's initial position, according to the quaternion: <br />
q=[ cos(t/4), sin(t/4)cos(t)/2, sin(t/4)sin(t)/2, âˆš(3/4)sin(t/4)].

The rubber sheet is viewed from above. <br />
Pressing SPACE causes our virtual camera to stick to the first ball not yet absorbed, so we can follow its point of view. <br />
If no ball is alive, the camera returns to initial position.
